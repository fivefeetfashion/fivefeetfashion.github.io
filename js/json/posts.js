      text: "I was 7 years old when my family moved to Mumbai and I was very fortunate to grow up in such a milieu. The people in the city impacted me in small but significant ways. Wearing trendy clothes, watching Fashion TV, beauty and makeup videos on Youtube, making fashion illustrations and looking at pictures of models in magazines. I was intrigued by how a combination of colours and patterns could change the dynamics of a piece of cloth and become a new trend on a global scale. It spiked my curiosity, and I wanted to learn how this industry worked, and soon, I realised that my passion lied there. <br><br>Now, i'm a Bangalore girl but the culture never left me. I found solace in my design classes, where I could dive into the art and learn more. But I didn't only learn how to draw or make illustrations, I started to understand the inner workings of the fashion industry, bit by bit. It was much bigger and expansive than I expected. My desire to learn and be a part of this industry kept growing. And to put all the numerous hours into fruition, I created this blog to spread my passion and inspire a similar one in other people. <br><br>Why five feet fashion? Well, I'm 5 feet tall and i love fashion. Pretty simple right? <br><br>So, welcome to my blog. I hope you have a nice stay! :)"

Pretty rare to find them all in one affordable top! I have to admit, I was a tad wary at first of the cold shoulder cut, but when I wore it, it was a surprise how much I loved it! With primary color pom poms, you can’t go wrong for a fun spring brunch or window shopping."
